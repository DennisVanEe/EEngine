# EEngine
A 2D video game engine based on the SFML api with AngelScript implementation.

The game engine has no UI and utilizes a script modules as the basis for making games 
(this includes loading resources, behaviour, game UI, etc.). Currently, an unfinished game
called the Aeneid and a compilation test program for the scripts exist:
